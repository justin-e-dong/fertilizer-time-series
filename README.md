# Fertilizer Time Series Analysis
## About Project
This time series analysis was developed in Spring 2022 for the [Northwestern University Investment Management Group](https://www.nuimg.org/) to support team efforts to develop a stock pitch on [CF Industries](https://www.cfindustries.com/) (NYSE: CF). The data came from [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). An ARIMA model was used instead of an LSTM model because there were not enough data points.

### Conclusions
The ARIMA model's projections over the next five years (until 2027) supported a qualitatively based differentiated thesis that fertilizer prices will likely remain high for the next few years.

### Build With
**Languages:** R

**Libraries:** forecast

R was used for this project, instead of Python, because it enables quicker development of visualizations. That functionality was crucial because multiple datasets were explored throughout the project.
